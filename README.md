<h1>Welcome Back Premade Group Finder! 
</br>Made finding groups quick and easy!</h1>
</br>
<h2>Introduction</h1>
<p>I have done a total rework of the addon and added a bunch of new features to improve the QoL but also functionality of Blizzards Premade Groups! Making filtering and finding specific groups for your needs a lot more convenient. </p>
</br>
<h2>Features:</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>General</b></li>
<li>Blizzard only allows searches every ~3s so disabled the search functionality to avoid reaching the ERROR_STATE where no groups are shown.</li>
<li>Auto sign up with configurable what role you want to sign up as simply just left click a group to sign up.</li>
<li>Right click on a group when viewing raids and you can select to send your raid achievement for that specific raid to the leader (Prio goes: CE, Mythic Bosses in progress order, AOTC; Normal Clear).</li>
<li>You can always see the compositions even when signed up.</li>
<li>Added some information on how blizzard displays results.</li>
<li>Added a text with how many available results and how long it took to filter.</li>
<li>Merged PGF UI and Blizzard UI.</li>
<li>Extended the ResultsInset window.</li>
<li>Possibility to set a description which is used for continuous sign ups.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Dungeons</b></li>
<li>Added filtering on dungeon difficulty as well as specific dungeons for each difficulty.</li>
<li>Added filtering for leader score (you can hide all groups where the leader has less than X score).</li>
<li>Improved the sort functionality: 1. Your applications 2. Bnet Friends/Ingame Friends/Guildmates 3. Groups your group are eligible for in terms of roles 4. Age, putting newer groups further up.</li>
<li>Added the leaders score to the group name with coloring.</li>
<li>You can see what spec everyone is in the group even before you join in the group listing.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Raids</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Added filtering on raid difficulty or ALL as well as specific bosses for each difficulty.</li>
<li>Added SMART logic for figuring out if the raid is on the boss you are filtering on currently or are 1 boss away, exception for broodkeeper due to skip being possible so being very generous with groups on this</li>
</ul>
