<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I have been working on an addon that will alarm you and notify you about premade groups that are of your interest. I know some people here are looking for the rare mounts in WoD and at times you can see groups like "poundfist is up" but it can be frustrating and boring to spam update premade groups. So that is why I made this addon. Now you can enter custom keywords such as "poundfist", "poundfist is up", "up" or "Blackhand" and as soon as a group is created with that name you will get notified!</p>

<h1>Features:</h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>It automatically refreshes your premade group list every 30 seconds (you may change this interval to what ever you like)</b>
    <li> Profiles, to quickly swap between keywords
    <li> Sorts all groups by date rather than ID
    <li> Once a group is found containing your keywords you will be notified in the following ways:
    <ul>
        <li> Everything is customizable for your preferences.
        <li> A raid warning sound will be played!
        <li> You will automatically whisper yourself about the name of the group and what keyword was found!
        <li> You will automatically whisper all your <b>chosen</b> friends about that a group that you are looking for has been found. It will also let them know about which keyword was found and the name of the group to notify them as well!
        <li><b>You will automatically apply / sign up to the group or even groups if there are several!</b>
        <li> A movable text indicating a group has been found and informing you which one</li>
    </ul>
    <li> PS. It will only notify you once per group that is found to avoid spam.
</ul>
